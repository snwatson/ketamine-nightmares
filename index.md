## About
 
### What is it?

- It’s a resource for ANZCA primary exam candidates
- I plan to keep it up to date for as long as I am able
- Anaesthesia trainees in other countries may benefit
- Trainees in other critical care disciplines may benefit
 
### Why the name?

- It’s a tip of the hat to Propofol Dreams (hyperlink)
- It’s à propos, as any current or former victim of the primary exam will attest
- I’ve got no particular interest in the drug
 
### How to learn the content

- If you do use others’ notes for learning, then make sure they are good
