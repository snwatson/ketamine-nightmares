# About Ketamine Nightmares
 
## What is it?

- It’s bank of my answers to the Australian Anaesthesia Primary Exam SAQs
- Anaesthesia trainees in other countries may benefit
- Trainees in other critical care disciplines may benefit

## Why the name?
- It's a tip-of-the-hat to [Propofol Dreams](https://propofoldreams.wordpress.com)
- It's à propos, as any current or former victim of the exam will attest
